# Multi User IoT Garage Door System 
This project was to build a multi-user product using the Particle IoT Cloud Platform to handle users, devices and cloud computing tasks. We utilized Particle Photon boards to act as the garage door controlor, garage door to internet communicator and as an internet connected smart remote. 

A user can make an account, claim a photon to their account and then receive the status of their door and control it from the web.
